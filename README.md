# wd-screenshot

Provides [wd.js](https://github.com/admc/wd) methods that adds screenshot comparison using [gm](http://aheckmann.github.io/gm/) node library.

# Recommandations

I strongly recommend that you write a wd.js script that saves the original screenshot. This will saves you a lot of time when refactoring/redesigning your site. See an example [here](./examples/project1/utils/auto-save.js).


# Thank you!

I would like to thank [radialpoint](http://radialpoint.com) for organizing hackaton during office hours that allowed me to develop this tool.
